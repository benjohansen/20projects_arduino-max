# 07_dim2LEDs
- use Max to control the dimming (using PWM) of two LEDs on the Digital Sandbox (note: you cannot dim all five of D4-D8 pins on the Digital Sandbox because D4, D7, and D8 are not capable of PWM)
- based on Sparkfun's "[4. Dimming (the Easy Way)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion/4-dimming-the-easy-way)" experiment
