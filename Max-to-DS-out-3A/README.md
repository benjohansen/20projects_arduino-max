# Max-to-DS-out-3A

- use Max to control the color (using PWM) of the RGB LED on the Digital Sandbox
- based on Sparkfun's "[5. Color Mixing](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion/5-color-mixing)" experiment
- similar to Arduino's "[Read ASCII String](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/communication/ReadASCIIString)" built-in example
