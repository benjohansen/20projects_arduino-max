# Arduino-to-Max_button
- send the state of a button (digital pin) from the Digital Sandbox to Max
- nearly the same as Arduino's "[Digital Read Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/DigitalReadSerial)" built-in example (I use serial.print() rather than serial.println() and added some comments)
