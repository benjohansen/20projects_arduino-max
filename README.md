# max_digital-sandbox

This is a work in progress (beginning Feb.2022). I'll make it clear when this is complete, but I'm making it public even while I build this from the beginning.

# Purpose

This has been instigated by my need to provide my college students with a very clear documentation of how to enter into the world of physical computing with Max (by [Cycling'74](https://cycling74.com)). 

My initial goal is to provide examples of how to communicate between Max (by [Cycling'74](https://cycling74.com)) and [Sparkfun's Digital Sandbox](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12651) (an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) with real-world inputs and outputs attached). I'm beginning by simply making examples based on each of the examples jimblom clearly documented [this Sparkfun blog post](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion).
