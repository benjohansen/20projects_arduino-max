# 01_button
- send the state of a button (digital pin) from the Digital Sandbox to Max
- nearly the same as Arduino's "[Digital Read Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/DigitalReadSerial)" built-in example (I use serial.print() rather than serial.println() and added some comments)
- [Proof from Arduino source code that you can use 1 or HIGH and 0 or LOW](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/cores/arduino/Arduino.h#L40-L41)
