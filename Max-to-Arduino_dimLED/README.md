# Max-to-Arduino_dimLED

- use Max to control the dimming (using PWM) of an LED on the Digital Sandbox
- based on Sparkfun's "[4. Dimming (the Easy Way)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion/4-dimming-the-easy-way)" experiment
- similar to Arduino's [Fade](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Fade) built-in example
- will work for a motor (DS Addon) by changing output pin number to 3 (similar to and simpler than Sparkfun's "[15. Serial Motoring (Addon))](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion/15-serial-motoring-addon)" experiment, with just one-way communication)
