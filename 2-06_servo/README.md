# 2-06_servo

- use Max to control a servo motor hooked to the Digital Sandbox (using pulsed digital out - *not* PWM)
- based on Sparkfun's "[16. Servo Sweeper (Addon)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-sandbox-arduino-companion/16-servo-sweeper-addon)" experiment
- make sure the "charge" switch on the Digital SandBox is in the "off" position
